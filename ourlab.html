										<p><strong> Edmund Kunji </strong><br> Principal Investigator </br> </p>
									<p> I started my PhD in October 2018 and am working on the identification of mitochondrial transporters, with a scholarship from the Aker Foundation. I am fascinated by trying to understand basic mechanisms of life. I did my BSc in Molecular Biology at the University of Bergen, Norway, and obtained my MSc from the same university, where I did my thesis on the generation and maintenance of the mitochondrial NAD pool. I enjoy sports, and play polo here at the University of Cambridge. <br></br></p>

										<p><strong> Alannah King </strong><br>PhD Student</br> </p>
									<p> I started my PhD in the lab in July 2019. I'm working on a bioinformatics project to allow for the computational identification of mitochondrial carriers based on their symmetry. I'm funded by the Medical Research Council, and graduated in 2019 with a BA degree in Natural Sciences (Pathology) from the University of Cambridge. My undergraduate project was on pandemic influenza. In my spare time, I'm very fond of baking and board gaming. <br> </br></p>
